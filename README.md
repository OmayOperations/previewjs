# previewjs
A library to preview many different languages.
## Importing
To import previewjs, load previewjs from [JSDelivr](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/OmayOperations/previewjs/preview.js) or loadjs from [JSDelivr](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/OmayOperations/previewjs/load.js)
If you chose the former, than you will have to import each module in syntax such as [https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/OmayOperations/previewjs/src/html.js](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/OmayOperations/previewjs/src/html.js) but change the language (in this case HTML) to a language of your choosing.
